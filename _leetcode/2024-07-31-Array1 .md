## Binary Search

### Description
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

**Example 1**
```Python
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2**
```Python
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

### Note
**General Idea**: Use left and right node to define the range for exploration (Initially ```left = 0`` ``right = len(nums)```), so that ``mid`` can be used for binary search. 
**Difficulties**
  * How to define ```mid```.
  * How to update ```left``` and ```right```.
  * Conditions of while loop.

### Solution
**Python**
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        right = len(nums) - 1
        if (right == 0):
            if nums[0]==target:
                return 0
            else:
                return -1
        left = 0
        while (left <= right):
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if (target > nums[mid]):
                left = mid + 1
            elif(target < nums[mid]):
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
                
        return -1
```
